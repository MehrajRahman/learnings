# BINARY SEARCH

## Binary Search is a method for searching an element from a sorted list/array.

First of all, we will have to know 3 numbers. The lower, higher and that particular number we want to search.

Let's assume we are playing a game of guessing a number inside the range of 1 to 1000.
Here the lower range is 1 and upper range is 1000.

> There are 10 digits available in Decimal system, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but only two in binary 1 and 0.

| Decimal | Binary |
| ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0000   |
| 1       | 0001   |
| 2       | 0010   |
| 3       | 0011   |
| 4       | 0100   |
| 5       | 0101   |
| 6       | 0110   |
| 7       | 0111   |

In DECIMAL, we use 2 digits for writing Ten, 3 digits for writing Hundred, 4 digits for writing Thousand.
But in BINARY, we use 2 digits for writing Two, 3 digits for writing four, 4 digits for writing eight.

| 2           | 5         | 2       |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| 2x100 = 200 | 5x10 = 50 | 2x1 = 2 |

> = 252 in DECIMAL

| 1       | 0       | 1       |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1x4 = 4 | 0x2 = 0 | 1x1 = 1 |

> = (4 + 1) = 5 in BINARY
